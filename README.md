# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6

  For this challenge I made some recommended changes to take the travel app to another level. First I added detail to the weather data which is called the weather description. I then used input statements to filter the data for a customer's weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, I chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a driving travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
